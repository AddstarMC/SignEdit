SignEdit: A Bukkit plugin which allows signs to be easily edited while still on the wall/block they were placed on

Commands:
    - /signedit <line> <text> - Change the text on <line> to match that in <text>
    - /signedit delete <line> - Remove the text on the specified line
    - /signedit cancel - Cancel the current edit
    - /signedit help - Display a help dialogue

Permissions:
    - signedit.edit - Allows users to edit their own signs, and any signs they can access through LWC (If support is enabled)
    - signedit.override - Allows users (defaults to OPs) to protection
