SignEdit: A Bukkit plugin which allows signs to be easily edited while still on the wall/block they were placed on

Commands:
    - /signedit <line> <text> - Change the text on <line> to match that in <text>
    - /signedit delete <line> - Remove the text on the specified line
    - /signedit cancel - Cancel the current edit
    - /signedit help - Display a help dialogue
    
Changelog:
    1.0.2b: Change the commands around a bit, you can now type "delete" on a line
    1.0.1b: Add a configuration directive to ignore creative mode if a player has a pending SignEdit request, check to make sure the <line> parameter is an integer (1-4), add a help dialogue
    1.0: Initial release
    
Feaures:
    - LWC Integration.. If the sign doesn't belong to you, you can't change it.


TODO: 
    - Add a command to view previous edits performed on signs (People, time, what was edited)
